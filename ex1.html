      <h2>Introduction to Story:</h2>
      <p>This morning started like every morning, I woke up and quickly went to go clean Mango's cage. Mango is my bird. He is a very sweet and loving bird. As I was went downstairs I noticed that the cage door was open and my bird, Mango, was
        missing!! Then what happened?

      <h3>Story Ending One</h3>
      <p>I went out on a rescue search for my bird, looked in trees, and asked neighbors. Some were nice enough to join me in the search for Mango while some only shook their head.
        Eventually after hours of searching for my bird, I was able to find it. It was inside my house this whole time. I returned Mango to his cage and we moved on. But I am happy he was home.

      <h3>Story Ending Two</h3>
      <p>I searched everywhere, looked on every branch . But after a few days of intense searching, all hope was lost as my bird was not found, so I ended up getting a new bird, his name is Fiji. He is blue and dances. As for Mango the bird, he will
        forever be remembered in our hearts.
