<div class="first">
<h3>EBAY/AMAZON VS SMALL ONLINE STORES </h3>
One thing is for sure, AMAZON and EBAY have been around the longest; therefore, they have something that other stores don't have. Recognition.
They have made created a name that whenever people hear it, they immediately know what this is.


Amazon and Ebay are strong platforms where people do most of their online shopping. They are online platforms that have been in the internet for a very long time, almost from the time that the internet began to grow and become something implemented in our every day life.

It seems like small platforms also are trying to copy platforms like eBay and AMAZON.

The way they are styled seems to be, <b>1) A long BANNER on the top.</b> 2) three or more tumbnails as you scroll down. <b>3) Table of contents are on top.</b>
